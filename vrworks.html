						<p>When I was hired, company required a VR solution for presentations. Therefore here I am, worked with VR goggles. I researched about how to build a VR & AR workflow and had meetings with several well-known companies such as IrisVR - Prospect. So, we succeeded on that duty with Enscape and other 3rd party programs.</p>
