						<h3>The next episode of 3D printing will involve printing entirely new kinds of materials. <br \>
						Eventually we will start printing complete products like circuits or motors.</h3>
						<p>I still don't have my own 3D printer(shame!) but I like those machines so much. Why ? Because it is genius to convert a "mesh" or solid file to gcode and let several motors move a hot nuzzle and create something from melted plastic. Also that is not an expensive process and fully customizable. I'm just intrigued by that idea which allows me to repair or replace any part that is broken or produce something that resembles a smaller representation of the final product. Models, mock-ups, statues, parts that have a purpose or anything you can imagine, it can be made in real just by a printer. Isn't that Awesome? Here are some models and 3d prints made by me:</p>

						<h4>Mask Holder for Co-Workers</h4>
					</header>
					<p>When I started working at EMAY International Engineering, Covid-19 hit the whole world and we had to use face masks for protection. During the early days of the pandemic, no one was used to wearing masks and it is kind of hard to get a mask holder because of not enough stock. So, I designed a mask holder in Fusion 360 and printed about 100 of them.</p>

						<h3>Simple Hanger</h3>

					<p>This is a complete random model I made. I required some place to put my bag and I just solved that problem with a simple 3d print. It was strong enough to carry my bag so it just worked.</p>

						<h3>Pedestrian Bridge and Model Mock-Up</h3>
					</header>
					<p>My Co-worker designed a pedestrian bridge. We just wanted a mock-up model to show people how it is going to look like. Therefore I printed the model for him.</p>

						<h3>Fix and Maintenance</h3>

					<p>One day, our printer decided to get a piece of  filament stuck into the nuzzle part and it was completely clogged. I have to research and find a fix for it. Then I have maintained and repaired it with some effort.</p>

					<p>This is a 1/32 scaled real steel joint for display. Even though it is a plastic print, it just holds a real weight as much as like the full scale version.</p>
